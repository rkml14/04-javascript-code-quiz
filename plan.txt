what I need:

    start-button - linked to a timer  to appear on screen 
        variable timer-count  ( start at 60 seconds )
        show a timer on screen
        variable penalty-time 
        event.listener("click", function{})
        timer function

    questions render to the page
        probably some sort of loop, 5 questions

need endQuiz
    total score of right answers, displays for user
    stops timer
    resets timer
    asks for initials
    stores & displays initials plus score
