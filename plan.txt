Start button
    begins timer upper screen   60 seconds
    load question #1


loop - question 1 to 5 
 Question #1 
    load question & answers for user
    if question right
        text "correct, answer is: "
        next question
    else if question wrong
       text "wrong, answer is:" 
        subtract 5 seconds
        next question

 all questions answered or timer = 0
    final score = time left
    enter in initials for high score
    submit button

submit should show high scores

restart button




what I need:

    global array with questions and answers - done

    start-button - linked to a timer  to appear on screen 
        variable timer-count  ( start at 60 seconds )
        show a timer on screen
        variable penalty-time 
        event.listener("click", function{})
        timer function

questions render to the page
probably some sort of loop, 5 questions
