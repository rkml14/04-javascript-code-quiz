# 04-javascript-code-quiz

## Description

This application was built to create a timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions for the user to test their coding knowledge.   The application was created to to practice creating a dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.  

Once the user opens the application, they are given 60 seconds to answer 5 questions based on coding.  For every wrong answer, they lose 10 seconds from their time. The game ends once they've answered all 5 questions to their best of their ability or until time runs out, which ever comes first.

At the end, they are invited to submit their initials & final score for the High Scores tracking.
